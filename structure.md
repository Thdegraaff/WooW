% Workshop on Open Workflows 
% (WooW)
% Dani Arribas-Bel & Thomas De Graaff

# Outline

- Introduction: Why discuss this and why this workshop
- Tools for (open) workflows (Examples)

    * Editing 
    * Writing 
    * Analysing
    * Saving

- Conclusion 

# Introduction

## *Why* this workshop?

- Interest in workflow tools
- Increasing need for openness & transparancy

    * from journals, universities and government
    * increase in cooperation (over wider distances)
    * access to your own files

- In the *social sciences* few attention to what tools to use (and why)

## What this workshop *is* and *is not*

- We are not advocating tools
- instead, we are more interested in the principles behind a good open (scientific) workflow, aware of the facts that

    * there is no final, optimal set of workflow tools
    * investing is very costly
    
- aiming for a broader discussion 


# Workflow 

## Open?

* Workflow: 
  *Progression of steps (tasks, events, interactions) that comprise a work process, involve two or more persons, and create or add value to the organization's activities* ([BusinessDictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/workflow.html))

* Open workflow: One that enhances *transparency*, *collaboration* and *reproducibility*

## Empirical cycle
* Read other papers
* Think of a brilliant idea
* Do:
    1. Collect data
    2. Transform data
    3. Analyze data
    4. Write up results
    5. Present results
    6. Go back to 1. until satisfied
* Send paper to journal and go back once again to i. until referees satisfied
* And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

## Theoretical cycle
* Read other papers
* Think of a brilliant idea
* Do:
    1. State assumptions
    2. Model (simulate)
    3. Analyze model outcome
    4. Write up results
    5. Present results
    6. Go back to i. until satisfied
* Send paper to journal and go back once again to i. until referees satisfied
* And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

## Why should it be open?

* Open Science
* Reproducibility
* Transparency
* Modularity
* Portability (across systems and users)
* Efficiency
* Self-sanity

## When should I adopt an open workflow?

* The sooner the better
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly)
* Start one step at a time 

*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step* 

Lao-tzu

# Tools for ...
##open workflows

## Text editting

* Plain text is **simple**, light, cross-platform, flexible...
* Many **academic** a tools are based on plain text (typesetting systems, scripting
        languages, bibliography managers)
* **Good investment** to learn a rich text editor ("learn once, use for
        everything"):
    
    * Efficient typing (command Vs. insert modes)
    * Syntax highlighting and indenting
    * Shortcuts, macros and templates
    * Consistent look, feel and behaviour
    
* Examples: Vim, Emacs, other (TextMate, Sublime text, etc.,...)

## Text editting

Vim demo...

* Command Vs Insert mode
* Syntax highlighting
* LaTeX shortcuts
* Python indenting

## Beautiful (and efficient) typesetting

* Documentation of progress, presentation of results (paper or slides) and
  final products depend on this
* **plain text** + **markup languages** = very powerful

    * Dettach content inputting from layout and styling
    * One source, multiple outputs (paper, slides, website...)

* Examples: LaTeX, Markdown, Org

## Beautiful (and efficient) typesetting

**LaTeX** and **Beamer**...

* General template
* Sectioning
* Equations (inline, outside)
* Table

**Markdown**...

## Managing lists of papers

* *One reference list to rule them all*
* Create the reference and never worry about proper inserting

    * Bibtex
    * Reference manager
    * Online services (e.g. Mendeley)

* Bibtex demo...

## Analyzing data

* **Platforms** for statistical analysis & **scripting languages**
* Examples: Python, R, STATA
* The power of code Vs. point-and-click

    * **Flexibility** (Python)
    * Typically **wider range** of methods (STATA)
    * **Extensible** and updated more rapidly (R)
    * **Reproducible** and transparent (remember *exactly* what you did)

## Analyzing data

IPython notebook demo...

* Load up data
* Create descriptives
* Scatter plot
* Run a model and simple print
* Print LaTeX output

## Saving the workflow

**Backup**: "You don't need it until you really need it"

* Security copy of all your (valuable) documents
* External drive Vs. Cloud solution
* Software to make the process painless or automated
* Many options: TimeMachine, Amazon Glacier...

## Saving the workflow

**Versioning control**: *"How did I get to that table of results?"*

* Save snapshots of a project in an intelligent way
* Allows to trace the *history* of a project/document (very neat [example](http://flowingdata.com/2012/11/30/time-lapse-writing-of-a-research-paper))
* Very well developed for code development
* Examples: DropBox, git, svn...
