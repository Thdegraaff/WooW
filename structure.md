# Workshop on Open Workflows (WoOW)
Test change

## Introduction (30/45min.)

### What is a workflow

* Definition here
* Components of the workflow of the typical Social Scienctist

    * Read other papers
    * Think of a brilliant idea
    * Collect data
    * Transform data
    * Analyze data
    * Write up results
    * Present results
    * Go back to results and modify them
    * Get results published
    * Answer interested readers about your research
    * And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

### What is an open workflow
One that enhances *transparency*, *collaboration* and *reproducibility*

### Why should a workflow be open?

* Open Science
* Reproducibility
* Self-sanity

### When should I adopt an open workflow?

* The sooner the better
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly)
* Start one step at a time (*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a
  single step*, Lao-tzu)

## Tools for open workflows (60/75min.)
This section will really focus on the principles that inspire tools for Good
workflows, rather than on the tools themselves (although examples are given as
illustration).

### Writing

#### Text editting

* The blessings of plain text and why it pays off to invest in a (good) text editor
* Suggestions

    * Vim
    * Emacs
    * Other (TextMate, Sublime text...)

#### Beautiful (and efficient) typesetting

* Hello plain text
* Easily convert to a multitude of formats (e.g. LaTeX, HTML)
    * LaTeX
    * Org
    * Markdown

#### Managing lists of papers

* *One reference list to rule them all*
* Create the reference and never worry about proper inserting

    * Bibtex
    * Reference manager
    * Online services (e.g. Mendeley)

### Analyzing data

* The power of code Vs. point-and-click
* Platforms for statistical analysis of data

    * Python
    * R
    * STATA

### Saving the workflow

* Backup: "You don't need it until you really need it"
* Versioning control: "How did I get to that table of results?"

## Conclusion

TBD
