# Outline

- Introduction: Why discuss this and why this workshop
- Tools for (open) workflows (Examples)

    * Editing 
    * Writing 
    * Analysing
    * Saving

- Conclusion

## *Why* this workshop?

- Interest in workflow tools
- Increasing need for openness & transparancy

    * from journals, universities and government
    * increase in cooperation (over wider distances)
    * access to your own files

- In the *social sciences* few attention to what tools to use (and why)

# Workflow 

## Open?

* Workflow: 
  *Progression of steps (tasks, events, interactions) that comprise a work process, involve two or more persons, and create or add value to the organization's activities* ([BusinessDictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/workflow.html))

* Open workflow: One that enhances *transparency*, *collaboration* and *reproducibility*

## Empirical cycle
* Read other papers
* Think of a brilliant idea
* Do:
    1. Collect data
    2. Transform data
    3. Analyze data
    4. Write up results
    5. Present results
    6. Go back to 1. until satisfied
* Send paper to journal and go back once again to i. until referees satisfied
* And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

## Theoretical cycle
* Read other papers
* Think of a brilliant idea
* Do:
    1. State assumptions
    2. Model (simulate)
    3. Analyze model outcome
    4. Write up results
    5. Present results
    6. Go back to i. until satisfied
* Send paper to journal and go back once again to i. until referees satisfied
* And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

## Why should it be open?

* Open Science
* Reproducibility
* Transparency
* Modularity
* Portability (across systems and users)
* Efficiency
* Self-sanity

## When should I adopt an open workflow?

* The sooner the better
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly)
* Start one step at a time 

*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step*

# Tools for ...
##open workflows

## Text editting

* The blessings of plain text and why it pays off to invest in a (good) text editor
* Suggestions

    * Vim
    * Emacs
    * Other (TextMate, Sublime text, etc.,...)

## Beautiful (and efficient) typesetting

* Hello plain text
* Easily convert to a multitude of formats (e.g. LaTeX, HTML)
    * LaTeX
    * Org
    * Markdown

## Managing lists of papers

* *One reference list to rule them all*
* Create the reference and never worry about proper inserting

    * Bibtex
    * Reference manager
    * Online services (e.g. Mendeley)

## Analyzing data

* The power of code Vs. point-and-click
* Platforms for statistical analysis of data

    * Python
    * R
    * STATA

## Saving the workflow

* Backup: "You don't need it until you really need it"
* Versioning control: "How did I get to that table of results?"

# Conclusion
