# Workshop on Open Workflows (WooW)

## Introduction (30 min.)

### What are we going to do

#### Contents

1. Introduction: Why discuss this and why this workshop
2. Tools for (open) workflows (Examples)
  1. Editing 
  2. Writing 
  3. Analysing
  4. Saving
3. Conclusion 

### Why this workshop?

#### Why this workshop?

* Interest in workflow tools
* Increasing need for openness & transparancy
   * from journals, universities and government
   * increase in cooperation (over wider distances)
   * access to your own files
* In the *social sciences* few attention to what tools to use (and why)

### What is a workflow?

#### Empirical cycle
* Read other papers
* Think of a brilliant idea
* Do:
  1. Collect data
  2. Transform data
  3. Analyze data
  4. Write up results
  5. Present results
  6. Go back to i. until satisfied
* Send paper to journal and go back once again to i. until referees satisfied
* And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

#### Theoretical cycle
* Read other papers
* Think of a brilliant idea
* Do:
  1. State assumptions
  2. Model (simulate)
  3. Analyze model outcome
  4. Write up results
  5. Present results
  6. Go back to i. until satisfied
* Send paper to journal and go back once again to i. until referees satisfied
* And... documenting throughout the entire process!!!

#### What is an open workflow?

* Workflow: 
  *Progression of steps (tasks, events, interactions) that comprise a work process, involve two or more persons, and create or add value to the organization's activities* ([BusinessDictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com))

* Open workflow: One that enhances *transparency*, *collaboration* and *reproducibility*

#### Why should a workflow be open?

* Open Science
* Reproducibility
* Transparency
* Modularity
* Portability (across systems and users)
* Efficiency
* Self-sanity

#### When should I adopt an open workflow?

* The sooner the better
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly)
* Start one step at a time (*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a
  single step*, Lao-tzu)

## Tools for open workflows (60/75min.)
This section will really focus on the principles that inspire tools for Good
workflows, rather than on the tools themselves (although examples are given as
illustration).

### Writing

#### Text editting

* The blessings of plain text and why it pays off to invest in a (good) text editor
* Suggestions

    * Vim
    * Emacs
    * Other (TextMate, Sublime text...)

#### Beautiful (and efficient) typesetting

* Hello plain text
* Easily convert to a multitude of formats (e.g. LaTeX, HTML)
    * LaTeX
    * Org
    * Markdown

#### Managing lists of papers

* *One reference list to rule them all*
* Create the reference and never worry about proper inserting

    * Bibtex
    * Reference manager
    * Online services (e.g. Mendeley)

### Analyzing data

* The power of code Vs. point-and-click
* Platforms for statistical analysis of data

    * Python
    * R
    * STATA

### Saving the workflow

* Backup: "You don't need it until you really need it"
* Versioning control: "How did I get to that table of results?"

## Conclusion

TBD
