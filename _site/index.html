<h1><em>Welcome!</em></h1>

<p>Did you ever:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>had to go back to the regression code you wrote months ago to replicate a table that a referee wants slightly different and been unable to trace how in hell it was created in the first place?</em></li>
<li><em>think that it would be nice if you could easily access the code for that relevant paper whose results do not make much sense?</em></li>
<li><em>suffer from a disk failure and lost some of your files because no backup was in place?</em></li>
<li><em>argue with co-authors which document version was the latest?</em></li>
</ul>


<p>A recent controversy over a Harvard study (<a href="http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/04/umass-student-exposes-serious-flaws-harvard-economists-influential-study/64357/">link</a>) shows that there is clearly a need for more transparency and better practices in the way
economic research is carried out. At the same time, government
(<a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/outputs.aspx">example</a>) institutions
and universities
(<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices">example</a>)
are also progressively pushing for a more open and reproducibility-prone
policy in the way publicly funded research is made available. We will discuss
why these initiatives are important and how you can start adopting them in the
way you conduct research day-to-day.</p>

<p>This is the main site of the Workshop on open Workflows (WooW). Here you
will find the <a href="slides.html">slides</a> used in the session, code snippets shown as
<a href="examples.html">examples</a> as well as a list of further
<a href="references.html">references</a> on much of
the material covered. Although the slides and examples will likely not change
after the workshop, it is our intent to update the references to include more
resources we find useful.</p>

<h2><em>What</em></h2>

<p>The seminar will be divided in two parts: first, a conceptual introduction
will cover why and what particular best practices should be followed when
carrying out research in economics; a second, longer and more practical part will introduce and illustrate some
of the most commonly used tools that reflect the principles outlined before.
This will include, among others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plain text editors</li>
<li>LaTeX and other markup typesetting systems</li>
<li>Bibliography managers</li>
<li>Command-line statistical packages like Stata, R or Python</li>
<li>Backup and version control systems.</li>
</ul>


<p>Given time constraints and for the sake of keeping it general we will give an
overview of what such tools are but will not cover any of them in depth (e.g.,
this is not a tutorial on Stata or LaTeX).</p>

<h2><em>When</em></h2>

<p>Thursday January the 16th., 2014. from 15:00 to 17:00.</p>

<h2><em>Where</em></h2>

<p>Room 1G-10 of the main VU building.</p>
