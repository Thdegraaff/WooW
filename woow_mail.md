Dear Department members,

Together with Thomas de Graaf, we are offering next January 16th. a 2h
seminar/**Workshop on open Workflows** (WooW) for economists. Have you ever had to
go back to the regression code you wrote months ago to replicate a table that
a referee wants slightly different and been unable to trace how in hell it was
created in the first place? You also think it would be nice if one
could easily access the code for that relevant paper whose results do not make much sense? Have you recently suffered
a disk failure and lost some of your files because no backup was in place? If
so, you are not the only one: recent
scandals ([example](http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/04/umass-student-exposes-serious-flaws-harvard-economists-influential-study/64357/))
have made clear the need for more transparency and better practices in the way
economic research is carried out. At the same time, government
([example](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/outputs.aspx)) institutions
and Universities
([example](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices))
are also progressively pushing for a more open and reproducibility-prone
policy in the way publicly funded research is made available. We will discuss
why these iniciatives are important and how you can start adopting them in the
way you conduct research day-to-day.

The seminar will be divided in two parts: first, a conceptual introduction
will cover why and what particular best practices should be followed when
carrying out research in Economics; a second, longer and more practical part will introduce some
of the most commonly used tools that reflect the principles outlined before.
This will include, among others: 

* Plain text editors 
* LaTeX and other markup typesetting systems
* Bibliography managers
* Command-line statistical packages like Stata, R or Python
* Backup and version control systems.

Given time constraints and for the sake of keeping it general we will give an
overview of what such tools are but will not cover any of them in depth (aka
this is not a tutorial on Stata or LaTeX). 

If any of this sounds of interest to you, send us an email to confirm
attendance and please feel free to redistribute this to other people you think
could be interested.
