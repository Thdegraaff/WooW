# Examples

In the workshop, we show several examples using some of the tools we talk
about. You can find all of them in the examples folder of our
[repository](https://github.com/darribas/WooW/tree/master/examples). There you
will find the files below.

---

## `beamer.tex`

Source file to create a set of slides in LaTex using the
[beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) package.

---

## `example.R`

[R](http://r-project.org) code to reproduce a simple statistical example in which data from a `csv` file is
loaded, some basic descriptives are run and an OLS model is
estimated, outputting the results into a normal and a LaTeX table.

---

## `markdown.md`

Text written in the [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
mark-up language.

## `python.ipynb`

[IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to reproduce a 
simple statistical example in which data from a `csv` file is
loaded, some basic descriptives are run and an OLS model is
estimated, outputting the results into a normal and a LaTeX table.
You can also see a rendered version of the raw file online
[here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/darribas/WooW/blob/master/examples/python.ipynb).
